# Cybernetic Plan: mpx v3, cross-platform (Windows)

## Context

mpx is a transparent terminal multiplexer: a daemon owns the PTY master and
forwards bytes verbatim; clients are dumb terminals; ttty models the screen
only for attach snapshots. It is currently POSIX-only. Goal: native Windows
support (ConPTY, Win10 1809+) plus CI covering all four primary targets:
linux-amd64, linux-arm64, macOS-universal, windows-amd64 (termux-arm64 stays
as the fifth, untouched).

The v0-v2 plan (multiplexer core, ttty integration, multi-client, TCP relay)
is complete; history lives in git history of this file at `3f8c6dc` and below.

Code that matters: `src/mpx/pty.nim` (openpty/fork/ioctl), `protocol.nim`
(AF_UNIX + TCP, read/write on socket fds), `client.nim` (termios raw mode,
SIGWINCH self-pipe, selectors loop), `daemon.nim` (selectors event loop,
outq/inbuf queues), `mpx.nim` (fork-daemonize, kill via SIGTERM, ls),
`session.nim` (S_ISSOCK discovery, O_EXCL locks), `runtime.nim` (/tmp dirs).

Decisions already made, do not relitigate:

- **Transport on Windows**: loopback TCP + a `<name>.port` file in mpxDir.
  Reuses the existing TCP framing and mkAttach vetting. Named pipes (DACLs,
  per-SID namespace like wmux) are a future hardening step, not now.
- **Daemon loop on Windows**: WaitForMultipleObjects on WSA socket events
  plus a pty-data event; ConPTY is read by a blocking reader thread and
  written by a blocking writer thread (queues + events). Anonymous pipes
  are not selectable; threads are the honest translation of epoll here.
- **MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS is 64**: cap attached clients at 56 on Windows.
- **Windows daemon has one TCP listener, not two**: there is no unix
  socket to mirror, so the listener is the endpoint. It binds
  127.0.0.1:4534 by default (first free port upward) and cfg.listen
  moves it off loopback, same as -l on posix; the port lands in the
  .port file either way, and every client is mkAttach-vetted.
- **Client on Windows**: console mode raw VT input, resize detected by a
  250ms poller thread (there is no SIGWINCH on Windows), loop waits on
  console input handle (waitable) + socket event + resize event. Ctrl-G
  (0x07) detach logic is unchanged.
- **protocol.nim**: socket I/O becomes `send`/`recv` on both platforms
  (read/write on fds does not work on Windows sockets). Nonblocking via
  `ioctlsocket(FIONBIO)` on Windows, fcntl elsewhere.
- **Win32 imports** live in one new module `src/mpx/win.nim` (importc,
  dynlib kernel32/user32/ws2_32, stdcall). No other module declares raw
  Win32 procs.
- **Default shell on Windows**: pwsh.exe, else powershell.exe, else cmd.exe.
- **Spawning the daemon on Windows**: CreateProcessW with
  DETACHED_PROCESS (no console: CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT never reaches it) and
  CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB (escapes sshd's job object). If breakaway is
  refused, warn on stderr and continue (wmux precedent).
- **Local verification limits**: this sandbox has no mingw and no Windows.
  Per-module Windows verification is `nim check --os:windows --cpu:amd64`.
  Runtime verification of Windows code happens on the CI windows runner.
- Windows version floor: 10 1809 (ConPTY). Note in README.

House rules: read `~/p/3CODE.md`. No macros. No em dashes in anything
committed. Commit per step, short one-liners, stage specific files, never
push, no nimble install after commits.

## Current State

Steps 1-5 done. `src/mpx/win.nim` is the one import layer: it re-exports
std/winlean and declares what winlean genuinely lacks (ConPTY trio +
HPCON, STARTUPINFOEXW + attribute-list procs,
GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo and its types, CreateThread,
EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT,
CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB, CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP,
PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE, ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE/ERROR_NO_DATA,
initWinsock). Step 3 found winlean has neither SOCK_STREAM nor htons at
all, so win.nim supplies those too now (SOCK_STREAM = 1, a ws2_32
htons). Callers of mpx/win use winlean's camelCase spellings
(createEvent, setEvent, openProcess, createFileW with GENERIC_WRITE/
FILE_SHARE_*/CREATE_NEW/FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, wsaEventSelect,
getConsoleMode, and so on) via the re-export; winlean's
ERROR_FILE_EXISTS (80) covers the lock-claim retry.

`src/mpx/pty.nim` has both branches behind one API: defaultShell()
($SHELL on posix, pwsh/powershell/cmd probe on Windows, empty cmd means
default shell), openPty/setSize/read/write/close, the Windows Pty
carrying hpc/inWrite/outRead/hProcess with blocking ReadFile/WriteFile.

protocol.nim compiles on both platforms as of step 3: imports split the
pty.nim way (`when defined(windows): import mpx/win else: import
std/posix`), sendMsg/readFull use send/recv (posix EINTR retry kept
behind a wasInterrupted helper since winsock has no signal
interruption), a private sockClose wraps closeSocket/posix.close,
setNonBlocking uses ioctlsocket(FIONBIO) on Windows, connectUnix is
posix-only, connectTcp/listenTcp compile everywhere (sin_family branches
AF_INET vs TSa_Family), socketPath names the `.port` endpoint file on
Windows. runtime.nim: %TEMP% then %LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp on Windows.
session.nim: an EndpointExt const (.port vs .sock) drives
resolveSession's existence check and oldestSession's walk; the lock
claim uses createFileW(CREATE_NEW) with ERROR_FILE_EXISTS meaning "next
candidate"; windows-only daemonPort parses the .port file; isActive on
Windows = port in range + connectTcp to 127.0.0.1 succeeds. mpx.nim
calls initWinsock() as the first statement of main() on Windows.

daemon.nim compiles on both platforms as of step 5: the selector lives
inside Session (posix-only field), the shared client machinery
(flush/queue/broadcast/snapshot/handleClientMsg/feedClient, the loop's
frame parsing and mkAttach vetting factored into feedClient) is written
once against that, and each platform fills in the I/O edges. Windows
side: reader thread blocks in ReadFile into a shared buffer guarded by
a spinlock (Atomic[bool] exchange) and sets an auto-reset data event;
writer thread waits [stopEv, inEv] and drains the input queue with
blocking WriteFile; the loop is WaitForMultipleObjects over stopEv,
dataEv, the listener event, and one WSAEventSelect event per client
(FD_READ or FD_WRITE or FD_CLOSE, WSAEnumNetworkEvents as the reset),
with outq would-block handled by edge-triggered FD_WRITE instead of
posix's setInterest rearming. Transport is a single TCP listener:
127.0.0.1:4534 base by default (cfg.listen overrides, same scan), port
recorded in the .port file alongside the .pid; every client is vetted
through mkAttach like the posix -l path; 56-client cap at accept
(MaxClients, under the 64-handle ceiling); ptyEof (child exit) ends
the session, cleanup sets stopEv and gives the writer 1s before
closing handles. win.nim gained WSANETWORKEVENTS/WSAEnumNetworkEvents
and GetCurrentProcessId (winlean has neither). client.nim has both
platforms as of step 6: imports split the usual way (mpx/win plus
session/atomics/os on Windows, posix/termios/selectors plus pty for
Winsize elsewhere) and runClient is one export with a full body per
platform, the daemon.nim runDaemon precedent. Windows side: connect =
session.daemonPort + connectTcp(127.0.0.1, port) with cfg.listen's
address as fallback when loopback refuses (a daemon started with -l off
loopback never bound loopback), then mkAttach sent and mkAttached
required before anything else; console modes saved on both handles,
raw VT input (line/echo/processed cleared, ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT
set), best-effort VT processing on output; no SIGWINCH, so a
CreateThread poller samples GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo every 250ms,
stashes w/h in Atomic[int]s seeded with the initial size (so the first
sample emits no spurious resize) and pokes an auto-reset event; the
loop is WaitForMultipleObjects over resize event, the waitable console
input handle (readFile right after the wake, Ctrl-G lone-keypress
detach unchanged) and one WSAEventSelect FD_READ/FD_CLOSE event
(WSAEnumNetworkEvents as the reset); the socket is nonblocking once
selected, so frames accumulate in a buffer and takeFrame peels the
complete ones per wake; cleanup stops and joins the poller, restores
both console modes, closes everything. mpx.nim
doubles as of step 4: the std/posix import moved into the else branch
of the `when defined(windows): import mpx/win` split; the no-command
cmd comes from pty.defaultShell(); cleanSessionFiles/cleanStale/ls use
session's now-exported EndpointExt (.port on Windows) instead of a
hardcoded ".sock"; pathPresent is plain fileExists on Windows (a
.port file is regular, lstat stays for sockets); `new` daemonizes on
Windows via createProcessW with DETACHED_PROCESS or
CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB or CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP over the same
args list the fork path execvs, quoted through pty's now-exported
quoteArg, readiness = isActive or waitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, 0)
== WAIT_OBJECT_0; `kill` = openProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE) on the pid
file's pid + terminateProcess + the same stale sweep. Posix build/test
(29 OK)/example green plus a manual new/ls/kill smoke; windows check
clean on win, pty, protocol, runtime, session, daemon, client, and
mpx.nim's own code; as of step 6 `nim check --os:windows` on
src/mpx.nim is fully clean, the whole binary checkable for the first
time, plus a runtime smoke of the posix client (daemon, attach, Ctrl-G
detach exit 0, kill, clean sweep). Windows runtime behavior (daemon
threading and client console layer both) is check-verified but not yet
run on a real Windows box; step 7's tests are the first to exercise
it. One pre-existing bug surfaced by the smoke and present at HEAD
before step 6: `new` keeps only rest[1] as the command, so multi-word
commands drop their arguments (`mpx new sleep 30` execs a bare `sleep`,
which dies, which fails the readiness poll); fix as a standalone
commit or alongside step 7.

## Beck VM runtime findings (step 6 addendum)

Runtime testing on beck (Win11 26100, ssh as admin@beck, mingw
cross-compile, binaries deployed with scp) drove the full flow end to
end: `new cmd`, attach, live input/output roundtrip, detach, reattach
with the snapshot intact, ls, kill, clean sweep. Getting there surfaced
six bugs, all fixed and verified on the VM:

1. `CreateProcessW` with a non-null lpApplicationName does not
   PATH-search; a bare "cmd" failed with ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND. pty.nim
   now passes nil and lets the command line carry the name, the same
   deal execvp gives posix.
2. A stack-allocated STARTUPINFOEXW made CreateProcessW fail with
   ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (or silently drop the pseudoconsole
   attribute) in this mingw build on Win11 26100, while heap or static
   storage works and a plain C build with a stack struct works too.
   pty.nim heap-allocates the struct.
3. Without STARTF_USESTDHANDLES and invalid std handles (the shape
   microsoft/terminal's own ConptyConnection uses), a child spawned by
   a parent whose stdio is pipes instead of a console inherits those
   redirected handles and never talks to the pseudoconsole. Symptom:
   the shell's banner on the daemon's own stdout, an empty pipe.
4. The ConPTY session must be built from mpx.nim's main, one frame
   shallower than runDaemon; one frame deeper the spawned child again
   misses the pseudoconsole, deterministically, on this VM. The
   mechanism is unexplained (same depth as a passing checkpoint in the
   same binary); the empirical rule is recorded in newSession's doc
   comment.
5. The daemon's pty reader thread ran Nim allocations (seq.add) on a
   raw CreateThread that never initialized Nim TLS; the first output
   chunk killed the process instantly and silently. The reader now uses
   double fixed buffers swapped under the spinlock, zero allocations on
   that thread.
6. The client waited on the stdin handle directly in
   WaitForMultipleObjects; an anonymous pipe in the array makes the
   wait return "signaled" forever, so the loop parked in readFile and
   never saw the socket. stdin now arrives on a reader thread (same
   fixed-buffer discipline) and the loop waits on three events. Also,
   the client must drain the socket once before the wait loop: FD_READ
   is edge-set and misses bytes that land before the event select is
   armed.

Also fixed along the way: Windows SO_REUSEADDR lets a second daemon
double-bind the same port (SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE now), and the posix
client's unselectable-stdin fallback loop never noticed EOF and hung
forever on `attach < /dev/null` in this sandbox.

Known wrinkles left open: stale .port files make isActive report other
sessions as alive (connect success is not session identity; the CI
windows tests in step 7 should cover this), and this sandbox's
/dev/null does not support epoll, which is what exposed the EOF bug.

Local re-verification after all fixes: posix build + nimble test
(29 OK) + nimble example green; whole-binary `nim check --os:windows`
clean; the beck flow listed above passes.

## Steps

- [x] 1. **win.nim import layer.** Done. `src/mpx/win.nim` imports and
  re-exports std/winlean, so the pieces winlean already has (createPipe,
  createProcessW with `var STARTUPINFO` that a STARTUPINFOEXW's
  StartupInfo field satisfies, waitForSingleObject,
  waitForMultipleObjects, terminateProcess, getStdHandle, readFile/
  writeFile, socket/send/recv, MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS, DETACHED_PROCESS,
  SYNCHRONIZE, WSAData/wsaStartup) come from there. Declared fresh,
  dynlib kernel32/ws2_32 + stdcall: ConPTY (CreatePseudoConsole,
  ResizePseudoConsole, ClosePseudoConsole, HPCON = Handle, COORD),
  STARTUPINFOEXW, LPPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST, attribute-list procs
  plus PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE (0x00020016) and
  EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT, CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB,
  CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP, console (GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode,
  GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO, SMALL_RECT,
  the ENABLE_ line/echo/processed/VT flags), CreateEventW, SetEvent,
  CreateThread + ThreadProc, CreateFileW with GENERIC_WRITE/
  FILE_SHARE_*/CREATE_NEW, WSACreateEvent, WSAEventSelect, ioctlsocket
  with FIONBIO and FD_READ/FD_WRITE/FD_CLOSE, OpenProcess with
  PROCESS_TERMINATE. Added `initWinsock()` (WSAStartup 2.2, raises
  OSError). Verified: windows check clean, posix build + nimble test +
  nimble example green.
- [x] 2. **pty.nim Windows branch.** Done. Posix code gated behind
  `when not defined(windows)`, ConPTY branch behind the same `Pty` API.
  Shared `defaultShell()`: $SHELL on posix, findExe probe of pwsh.exe,
  powershell.exe, cmd.exe on Windows; an empty `cmd` means the default
  shell in both branches (mpx.nim still resolves non-empty cmds itself
  until step 4 rewires that). Windows Pty fields: hpc, inWrite, outRead,
  hProcess, the last so the daemon can WaitForSingleObject on child exit
  without relying on the read side. openPty: two non-inheritable
  createPipe pairs, CreatePseudoConsole(size, inRead, outWrite), our
  copies of the consumed ends closed, STARTUPINFOEXW sized attribute
  list carrying PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE, createProcessW with
  EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT passing `si.StartupInfo` to winlean's
  `var STARTUPINFO` param, minimal quoteArg for args, pi.hThread closed
  at once. setSize = ResizePseudoConsole. read/write = blocking
  ReadFile/WriteFile (winlean takes int32 counts); read maps
  ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE/ERROR_NO_DATA to 0 (EOF, like a posix master) and
  anything else to -1. close: inWrite first so the console sees input
  EOF, then ClosePseudoConsole, then outRead and hProcess. Error paths
  in openPty close what was opened before raising. Also fixed win.nim:
  pruned every declaration winlean already has (COORD, OpenProcess,
  GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode, SetEvent, WSACreateEvent,
  WSAEventSelect, CreateFileW, CreateEventW, and the ENABLE_/FD_/
  GENERIC_/FILE_SHARE_/CREATE_NEW/PROCESS_TERMINATE consts); they were
  ambiguous with winlean's camelCase versions at any use site.
  Verified: posix build + nimble test + nimble example green; windows
  check clean on pty.nim and win.nim.
- [x] 3. **Transport, discovery, protocol unification.** Done.
  protocol.nim: imports split the pty.nim way (`when defined(windows):
  import mpx/win else: import std/posix`); sendMsg/readFull call
  send/recv with cint counts, one-send-per-frame kept; the EINTR retry
  is posix-only behind a wasInterrupted helper (winsock has no signal
  interruption); a private sockClose wraps closeSocket/posix.close for
  error paths; setNonBlocking branches to ioctlsocket(FIONBIO,
  culong 1); connectUnix is gated `when not defined(windows)`;
  connectTcp/listenTcp compile on both platforms (sin_family from plain
  AF_INET on Windows, AF_INET.TSa_Family on posix); socketPath returns
  the `<name>.port` file on Windows. The step found winlean has neither
  SOCK_STREAM nor htons at all, so win.nim gained SOCK_STREAM (1) and a
  ws2_32 htons. runtime.nim: runtimeDir takes a Windows branch, %TEMP%
  then %LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp, "." as last resort; module doc updated.
  session.nim: posix import and unix-socket probe sit in the else
  branch; an EndpointExt const (.port vs .sock) drives resolveSession's
  existence check and oldestSession's dir walk; the lock claim uses
  createFileW(GENERIC_WRITE, share read+write, CREATE_NEW,
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL) with ERROR_FILE_EXISTS meaning "someone
  claimed it, next candidate"; windows-only daemonPort* parses the
  .port file; isActive on Windows = port in 1..65535 plus connectTcp
  to 127.0.0.1 succeeding. mpx.nim: `when defined(windows): import
  mpx/win` and initWinsock() as the first statement of main().
  Verified: posix build + nimble test (29 OK) + nimble example green;
  `nim check --hints:off --os:windows --cpu:amd64 --path:src` clean on
  protocol, runtime, session, and win/pty still clean. mpx.nim's own
  Windows branch stays check-unverifiable until steps 4-6 gate
  daemon/client, as the plan already expected.
- [x] 4. **mpx.nim Windows spawn/kill.** Done. `new` daemonizes on
  Windows with createProcessW (DETACHED_PROCESS or
  CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB or CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP) over the same
  args list the fork path execvs, quoted via pty.quoteArg (now
  exported); hThread closed at once, readiness polls isActive plus
  waitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, 0) == WAIT_OBJECT_0 for early exit,
  hProcess closed after. `kill` opens the pid-file pid with
  openProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE), terminateProcess, closeHandle, then
  the same sleep(100) + cleanSessionFiles sweep; the posix
  kill/waitpid branch is unchanged. `ls` and
  cleanSessionFiles/cleanStale use the now-exported session.EndpointExt
  instead of ".sock"; pathPresent is plain fileExists on Windows (a
  .port file is regular, lstat stays for sockets); the no-command cmd
  routes through pty.defaultShell(); mpx.nim's std/posix import moved
  into the else branch of the win split. Verified: posix build +
  nimble test (29 OK) + nimble example green plus a manual
  new/ls/kill smoke (daemonize, list, kill, sweep, no leftovers);
  check --os:windows clean on mpx.nim's own code, its only diagnostics
  being the pre-existing runDaemon cascade from daemon.nim's
  posix-only compile (step 5's job), and still clean on win, pty,
  protocol, runtime, session.
- [x] 5. **daemon.nim Windows event loop.** Done. The selector moved
  inside Session as a posix-only field so the shared client machinery
  (flushClient/queueClient/broadcast/queueSnapshot/flushPty/handleClientMsg)
  is written once; the loop's inline frame parsing and mkAttach vetting
  were factored into feedClient so both loops share them; addClient/
  dropClient/setInterest carry the platform edges. Reader thread blocks
  in ReadFile, appends to ptyOut under a spinlock (Atomic[bool]
  exchange/clear), sets an auto-reset data event; on EOF (broken pipe
  after child exit) it sets ptyEof and pokes the event again. Writer
  thread waits [stopEv, inEv], moves the whole input queue out under
  the spinlock, writes it fully with blocking WriteFile (backpressure
  parks there, not in the loop). Main loop: WaitForMultipleObjects over
  stopEv, dataEv, one FD_ACCEPT listener event and one per-client
  WSAEventSelect event, reset via WSAEnumNetworkEvents; outq would-block
  rides edge-triggered FD_WRITE (no setInterest equivalent needed);
  the data handler drains the chunk before the eof check so the child's
  last output is not lost when chunk and eof coalesce into one wake.
  Transport: single TCP listener, 127.0.0.1:4534 base by default,
  cfg.listen overrides (same startTcpListener scan), port written to
  the .port file, pid via GetCurrentProcessId next to it; every client
  is TCP-vetted through mkAttach; 56-client cap (MaxClients) at accept;
  cleanup sets stopEv, waits up to 1s for the writer, then closes
  clients/listener/events and sweeps .port/.pid/.lock. startTcpListener
  now takes (ip, basePort) instead of (sessionName, cfg). win.nim
  gained WSANETWORKEVENTS + WSAEnumNetworkEvents and GetCurrentProcessId.
  Verified: posix build + nimble test (29 OK) + nimble example green
  plus a manual daemon/ls/kill smoke; check --os:windows clean on
  daemon.nim, and src/mpx.nim now checks clean except client.nim
  (step 6). Windows runtime behavior is still unexercised: no real
  Windows box until step 7's tests.
- [x] 6. **client.nim Windows console layer.** Done. Imports split the
  pty.nim way and runClient is one export with a full body per platform
  (daemon.nim's runDaemon precedent); the posix body is unchanged, with
  the pty import moved into the posix branch (Winsize; unused on
  Windows). Connect: session.daemonPort + connectTcp(127.0.0.1, port),
  cfg.listen's address as fallback when loopback refuses, then mkAttach
  sent and mkAttached required before anything else, since every client
  on Windows arrives over TCP. Console: both handles' modes saved;
  input raw VT (clear line/echo/processed, set
  ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT) so keys arrive as the escape sequences
  a posix terminal sends; output best-effort VT processing. Resize: a
  CreateThread poller samples GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo every 250ms
  (there is no SIGWINCH on Windows), stashes w/h into Atomic[int]s and
  pokes an auto-reset event; the stash is seeded with the initial size
  so the poller's first sample emits no redundant resize. Loop:
  WaitForMultipleObjects over the resize event, the console input
  handle (waitable; readFile right after the wake, Ctrl-G lone-keypress
  detach identical to posix) and a WSAEventSelect FD_READ or FD_CLOSE
  event reset by WSAEnumNetworkEvents. wsaEventSelect forces the socket
  nonblocking, so daemon frames accumulate in a buffer and takeFrame
  peels complete ones per wake instead of recvMsg blocking mid-frame;
  the attach exchange runs before the event select precisely because
  it needs blocking reads. Cleanup: stop flag, 1s join of the poller,
  restore both console modes, close handles and socket. Verified: posix
  build + nimble test (29 OK) + nimble example green plus a manual
  smoke (daemon cat session, attach, Ctrl-G detach exit 0, kill, clean
  sweep); check --os:windows clean on client.nim and, for the first
  time, on src/mpx.nim as a whole. Windows runtime behavior of daemon
  and client both stays unexercised until step 7.
  Post-script: runtime testing on the beck VM the same day (cross-
  compiled here with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc, which turns out to be
  installed despite the "no mingw" note above) found and fixed six real
  Windows bugs; see the step 6 addendum in Current State.
- [ ] 7. **Tests and example.** Read tests/test1.nim and example/
  example.nim first, then extend: windows branches exercise openPty +
  ConPTY roundtrip with the resolved shell and daemon-over-loopback at
  wire level (no console needed; precedent: wmux tests drive the
  protocol directly). Keep posix paths intact. nimble test must pass on
  both ubuntu and windows runners. Verify: nimble test + nimble example
  green locally (posix).
- [ ] 8. **CI.** New .github/workflows/windows-amd64.yml mirroring
  linux-amd64.yml: runs-on windows-latest, build to mpx.exe, nimble
  test, package as zip (mpx-windows-amd64/ with mpx.exe, VERSION,
  README.md), artifact upload, capocasa.dev upload on main. release.yml:
  add windows-amd64.yml to the workflow wait list and
  mpx-windows-amd64.zip to Collect archive files (and its ls).
  Verify: YAML valid (`nim` not needed), steps mirror existing files.
- [ ] 9. **README + final review.** Replace "Windows: not supported"
  with a Windows section: Win10 1809+ floor, loopback TCP transport
  with the same name-gating caveat as -l, detach key unchanged, and the
  honest transparency asterisk (conhost re-renders the stream; passthrough
  mode is possible future hardening on Win11 22000+). Then the skill's
  Finishing pass: whole-diff review, full local matrix (build, test,
  example, check --os:windows on src/mpx.nim), clean committed tree.
